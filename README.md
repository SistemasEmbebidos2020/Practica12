## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create a systemd service to run a Python script on startup. The code provides step-by-step instructions on how to configure and execute a Python script using the Arduino or ESP32 board.

## Hardware Requirements

* Arduino or ESP32 board (e.g., Arduino Nano, ESP32 DevKitC)
* USB cable for programming
* MicroSD card (optional)

## Supported Boards

* Arduino Uno
* Arduino Mega
* ESP32 DevKitC
* Other boards with support for the Arduino IDE and/or PlatformIO

## Libraries Used

* None specifically required, but may require installation of Python and associated libraries (e.g., `python3`, `python3-pip`)

## Pin Configuration

No specific pin configuration is required for this project.

## Installation

To use this project with the Arduino IDE:

1. Install the latest version of the Arduino IDE from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
2. Install the Python and associated libraries on your system
3. Copy the `pasos.txt` file into your project directory

Alternatively, to use this project with PlatformIO:

1. Install PlatformIO from [platformio.org](https://platformio.org/)
2. Create a new project in PlatformIO and add the `pasos.txt` file as a dependency

## Compilation & Upload

To compile and upload the code to your board using the Arduino IDE:

1. Open the `pasos.ino` file in the Arduino IDE
2. Select the correct board from the Tools menu
3. Click on the "Verify" button to check for errors
4. Click on the "Upload" button to upload the code to your board

To compile and upload the code using PlatformIO:

1. Open the `pasos.cpp` file in a text editor
2. Create a new build configuration in PlatformIO and add the `pasos.txt` file as a dependency
3. Click on the "Build" button to check for errors
4. Click on the "Upload" button to upload the code to your board

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

* `pasos.txt`: A step-by-step guide on how to configure and execute a Python script using the Arduino or ESP32 board.
* `pasos.ino` (Arduino IDE): The main program file for the Arduino IDE
* `pasos.cpp` (PlatformIO): The main program file for PlatformIO

## Usage Example

To use this project, follow the instructions in the `pasos.txt` file to configure and execute a Python script using your Arduino or ESP32 board.

## Notes

This project requires a basic understanding of Linux systems and scripting. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create files and directories on your system.
